# Phoenix
Airborne and hive code for Phoenix dance project

# main remarks
As far as possible, all is in Python2.7 language

# Architecture
## The drone folder
contains the embedded code for the raspberry pi on the drone

## The hive folder
contains the code on the master computer Windows 10 which has high CPU.

## The pan-tilt folder
contains the test bench of fiducial pose estimation.

This code operates a pan-tilt turret with a Logitech c525 webcam (http://www.logitech.fr/fr-fr/product/hd-webcam-c525). The objective is to center an aruco marker with this turret and measure the relative position in centimeters.

## The test_opencv folder
contains some simple algorithms with open cv
